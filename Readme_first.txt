ON HOLD - CENTRAL BAR REINFORCMENT NEEDED

This plastic garden train "G" track bender is closely derived from the "oakbender" build in oak. 
This is one rare design which was usable at first print, however slightly improved since (to simplify screw supply).
Designed just for fun, to see how easier it could be built compared to oak building. 
BOM:
- bearings 608 (8x) and F688 (2x)
- Wood screw, countersunk head, diam 5x40 (6x)
- Medium washer M5 (8x) - below bearing
- Simple nut M4 (2x)
- Bolt M8x80 (2x) - bearing assembly
- Bolt M4x40 (3x), hex head - pusher and push bar assembly
- small washers M4 (4x)
- medium washer M4 (2x)
- Small washer M8 (4 x)

Set one washer below 608 bearings and two washers below F688 bearings

Printing recommendations
- Printing PETG or ABS. Prototype tested in PETG.
- Layer thickness : 0.3
- Fill-in : 100%
- 3 walls
- 5 layers on top and 5 layers on bottom
- In PETG, run hot for good interlayer adhesion, bridging is very limited.
- Printing time 4h to 6h depending your printer speed
- plastic weight: 95g (with above parameters and PETG - lighter in ABS)
- let the parts cool down on the bed before removing it.

Weight equipped with bearings : 300 g (in PETG)

With all parts supplied and printed, the assembly needs less than 1/4 h. 

Adapted for rail code minimum size 250 (screw head clearance is unsufficient for code 200 track)
Only tested on PECO code 250 silvernickel track (which is the hardest to bend due to spring effect)
You may need to add washers on the central flanged bearings for code 332 track.
While it is quite reinforced compared to first prototypes, 
 that is only plastic and less robust than the oak version.
It works for code 250 with thin bottom flange, but is not guaranteed for code 332.
In any case, do not use on stainless steel track, which are too stiff for this model.
On code 250 rails, this is the flange of the central bearing which contact rail, 
This prevent rail tilting, but you may experience some chips removed from rail web. 
Compared to comercially available track benders, the bearings are more spaced, which reduce
the stress in the bender, but slightly increase the straight ends length (by ~ 10mm). 

You shall bend your track in multiple passage, tightening the thumbwheel progressively.
Maintain the bender firmly pushed on the track.

To avoid straigt ends, you may weld rails before bending or cut the straight part,
you need to cut the internal rail anyway due to the curve.
Silvernickel rails are easy to weld, but this may not be possible with brass rail.
For silvernickel, use a welder of 100W or above and operate quickly to not melt the ties.

This plastic garden train "G" track bender is closely derived from the "oakbender" build in oak. 
This is one rare design which was usable at first print, however slightly improved since (to simplify screw supply).
Designed just for fun, to see how easier it could be built compared to oak building. 
BOM:
- bearings 608 (8x) and F688 (2x)
- Wood screw, countersunk head, diam 5 x 30 (6x)
- Medium washer M5 (6 x or 12x)
- Screw M4x60, countersunk head (1x)
- Butterfly nut M4 (1x)
- Simple nut M4 (1x)
- Bolt M8x80 (2x)
- Small washer M8 (4 x)

Printing recommendations
- Printing PETG or ABS. Prototype tested in PETG.
- plastic weight: 58g (with above parameters and PETG - lighter in ABS)
- Layer thickness : 0.3
-  Fill-in : Honeycomb 70%
- 3 walls
- 5 layers on top and 5 layers on bottom
- In PETG, run hot for good interlayer adhesion, bridging is very limited.
- Printing time 2.5h to 4h depending your printer speed

Aadpted for code 250 mini (screw head clearance is unsufficient for code 200 track)
Only tested on PECO code 250 silvernickel track (which is the hardest to bend due to spring effect)
You may need to add washers (especially on the central flanged bearings) for code 332 track for better force centering on the rail.
- Weight equipped with bearings : 254 g

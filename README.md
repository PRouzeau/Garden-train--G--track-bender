This 3D printed garden train "G" track bender is designed to bend flexible "G" tracks without disassembling them as is needed by simple rail benders<br>
It was tested on Code 250 Peco track in Silvernickel, which is very difficult to bend without tooling as it is very springy and always return back to its original shape.<br>  
It is closely derived from my original "oakbender" build in oak.<br>
Designed just for fun, to see how easier it could be built compared to oak building.<br>

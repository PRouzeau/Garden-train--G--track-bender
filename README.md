This plastic garden train "G" track bender is closely derived from the "oakbender" build in oak. <br>
This is one rare design which was usable at first print, however slightly improved and reinforced since (to simplify screw supply).<br>
Designed just for fun, to see how easier it could be built compared to oak building.<br>
